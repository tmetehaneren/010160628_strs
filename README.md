- Working principle of the code

  We use google earth engine API and geemap package for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, ipyleaflet, and ipywidgets. After the necessary updates are made in     the tools, we want to login to the google earth engine via google account.

  Afterwards, you can download your image on the base you want in the area we have chosen via API.






- Test Images

Our images are obtained using google earth engine. By running the program, you can see the land use information (albeit low resolution) of the region you want.
